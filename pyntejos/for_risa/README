These scripts are intended to cross-match cluster pairs with known UV
bright QSOs for potential observations with HST. - Nicolas Tejos

Steps:

# We need to create the cluster-pair catalog first
1.  Open create_cpair_catalog_config.py and point to the right
    redmapper fits table accordingly.
2. From terminal run:
    > python create_cpair_catalog.py

# Now we can do cross-match between cluster pairs and qsos
3. From terminal run:
    > python cross_match_cpairs_qsos.py

# Examine the results
4. Open the html table written in current working directory
